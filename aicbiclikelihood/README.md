# AIC and BIC

## Definition
The **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, Akaike is the name of its author)** and the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**, also called Schwartze (the name of its author) Criterion were defined in the seventies.
Based on the likelihood, they both define a way to penalize the model complexity [1][2].

These criteria were implemented using sklearn with results from gaussian mixture models.
