# Clustering : internal criteria

Some Python code to deal with internal measurement of clustering quality.
Each folder contains code, details of implementation and references :
* [AIC and BIC](aicbiclikelihood)
* [AIC and BIC considering K-means](aicbicinertia)
* [Negentropy increment](negentropy)
* [Stability and subsampling based](subsamp)

See https://github.com/nicolasdugue/pyFmax/tree/master/pyfmax for feature-based quality measure.
