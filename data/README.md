### .nrm files

These files are organized like .dat files. They are actually the original .dat files of the datasets but with normalization. 
These .nrm allowed to get the best clustering results.

### .elm

These files describe the clustering results. For each line i, the first column indicates the cluster the node i belongs to.

### . nrm

Describes the centroids of the clusters.

#### Help to read the files

The file common/ioreader/FileReader.py can be used to read those files.
